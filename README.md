SchoolDB Project: Student Results Management System
Overview
This project provides a database schema and conceptual design for managing student results within a school or educational institution. It's designed to track student performance, including marks, grades, and exam dates, across various subjects.

The database can be setup using a SQL client.

Features
Student Information Management: Stores student details such as name and unique student identifier.

Subject Management: Stores information about the subjects offered.

Result Tracking: Records student results for specific subjects, including marks, grades, and exam dates.

Data Relationships: Defines relationships between students, subjects, and their results using foreign keys.

Database Schema
The database schema consists of three tables:

Students:

StudentName (VARCHAR(255)): Name of the student.

StudentAdm (VARCHAR(20)): Student's admission number.

[Other student details...]

Subjects:

SubjectID (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment): Unique identifier for each subject.

SubjectName (VARCHAR(255)): Name of the subject.

[Other subject details...]

StudentResults:

ResultID (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment): Unique identifier for each result record.

StudentID (INT, Foreign Key): References Students(StudentID).

SubjectID (INT, Foreign Key): References Subjects(SubjectID).

Mark (INT): The mark obtained by the student in the subject.

Grade (VARCHAR(2)): The grade assigned to the student for the subject.

ExamDate (DATE): The date of the exam.

Relationships

A Subject can have multiple StudentResults.

Potential Use Cases

Generating student transcripts.

Tracking student performance over time.

Analyzing subject-wise performance.

Managing exam results.

Setup Instructions
Install a database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

Create a new database (e.g., schooldb).

Use a SQL client to execute the SQL statements provided in the "Database Schema" section to create the tables.  You can save the table creation statements into a file (e.g., schema.sql) and then import that file into your SQL client.

Once the tables are created, you can begin inserting data.
